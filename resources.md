Here is an excellent set of resources I have found for doing web development. Use these as an initial resource when you have questions (also don't forget about [Google](http://google.com) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com))

### [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

The Mozilla site is probably the most comprehensive and "bleading edge" documentation out there. Its a really good place to go if you have question about:

- New HTML5 APIs ([audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio), [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), and [IndexDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API))
- CSS3 ([flex box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex), [animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_animations))
- ES6 Javascript
- ES7 (if you *really* want to...)

When using any information on this site, be sure to check compatibility of the APIs with your intended market. Which leads to ... 

### [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/)

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-4 columns">
    <img src="/assets/images/CanIUse.png" alt="CanIUse"/>
  </div>
  <div class="large-8 columns">
  <p>CanIUse provides information about which browsers support which HTML, CSS, and Javascript APIs. Additionally, certain browsers support apis, but with certain prefixes (like <em>-webkit</em> or <em>-moz</em>). It can even tell you its "relative" support by comparing general browser usage statistics to the compatability information. </p>
    
    <p>TLDR when you are thinking about using a new-ish browser technology, checkout this website for more information about how well it's supported.</p>
