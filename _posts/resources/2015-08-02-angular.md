Angular JS is similar to [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/), however it's a little more "automagical" with regards to updating the DOM. Rather than requiring you to write most of the update code (actually thinking about the bindings), Angular has bindings already created for most common HTML elements, and just requires you to do the controller logic. This makes it a little easier to get up and running quicker, but when creating custom [directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive) or [services](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services) it can get more complicated.
