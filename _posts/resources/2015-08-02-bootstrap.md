Twitter Bootstrap is probably one of the most used front-end design frameworks. It offers a plethora of features, including:

* A super flexible and easy to use [grid layout](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)
* Awesome looking [buttons](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons)
* [navigation elements](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#nav)
* nice [typography](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type)
* and *much* nicer looking [forms](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms)

Bootstrap can be used to create a website from scratch in just a couple of hours, however you do end up having that "oh this was made with Bootstrap look". While it produces a nice website very quickly, it is a little bit more difficult to customize.
