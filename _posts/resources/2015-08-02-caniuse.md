CanIUse provides information about which browsers support which HTML, CSS, and Javascript APIs. Additionally, certain browsers support apis, but with certain prefixes (like *-webkit* or *-moz*). It can even tell you its "relative" support by comparing general browser usage statistics to the compatability information.
    
TLDR when you are thinking about using a new-ish browser technology, checkout this website for more information about how well it's supported.
