## Goal
The goal of this project is to make a sliding puzzle game similar to the game ["15" (example here](http://mypuzzle.org/sliding), or you may have played with a plastic version). This will give you more familiarity with HTML and CSS and some practice manipulating DOM elements with Javascript and JQuery.

## Files Provided
The following files are available here. Right click and save-as to save them to your machine and start working.

- [p1.js]({{'/assets/assignments/p1.js' | prepend: site.baseurl}}): JavaScript file that you will need to edit. Some skeleton code is provided for guidance, however you may implement this differently if you’d like.
- [duck.jpg]({{'/assets/assignments/duck.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl}}): sample image that you can use for your puzzle.
- [p1.zip]({{'/assets/assignments/p1.zip' | prepend: site.baseurl}}): All the above files, zipped up for easy downloading.

## Project Overview
For this project you will create a sliding block puzzle game similar to the popular game "15" using JavaScript. Your web app should do the following:

1. Make a 4x4 grid of tiles, each of which shows a separate portion of an image. This grid should automatically resize with the browser window. This means you should probably use some type of percentage-based layout in order to create the grid. One tile from this grid should be missing. 

2. Shuffle up the grid of tiles. Make sure that your shuffling results in a solvable puzzle state (hint: think of how you would shuffle a real puzzle like this).

3. If a valid tile is clicked, it should move to the empty square. If the tile is invalid nothing should happen.

4. Keep track of the current round's number of tiles moved and make a Javascript alert when the puzzle is correct. 

## Part I

For this part, draw a layout that meets the above constraints. In this layout, draw out the springs and stuts that will help your layout maintain its proportions when resized. You can draw your answer either in a drawing program or by hand (and then scan your work to turn it in electronically – but be sure it’s legible).  Each component in the layout should be represented as a rectangle (i.e., you don’t have to use the real appearance of the item in your specification).  You should assume that rectangular container regions can be filled with solid color or image backgrounds, and that components inside the container are drawn over the top of this background.  Since this layout contains a number of components in a small space, you might want to break out parts of the layout into separate drawings.  In that case, just place a labeled rectangle for the container in your main layout, then create a separate sub-layout diagram for that container.  Note that some of the components may be (slightly) more complex than immediately apparent in the single screen dump above and that Mac vs. PC versions of the interface may differ slightly in final appearance. 

You should assume that each sub-layout collection (each container which hosts a series of interactors plus springs and struts that lay them out) should be 1-dimensional – either a row or a column.  You should be sure to specify how the container lays out elements in the other direction (e.g., top, bottom, left, right, or center justified). For the grid portion, you can just indicate that a particular container's children have equal widths and/or heights.  

Example:

<img src="/assets/images/assignment_1_example.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;vertical-align: top;"/>
<img src="/assets/images/assignment_1_layout.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

Additionally, create the interactor hierarchy from the layout you created. This should be composed of HTML elements (you will basically be writing the HTML for your assignment). You should draw an interactor hierarchy using the tree-‐‐like method shown in class, but augment the interactors to specifically indicate which is a row and which is a column, and what the alignment should be for them. In addition, indicate whether the minimum and maximum width and height are equal; and whether they are controlled by the children (as with the width of a row) or fixed. You should be sure to specify how the container lays out elements in the other direction (e.g., top, bottom, left, right, or center justified). In your above diagram, be sure to label the elements so they are easily referenced by this tree.

### Turning It In
Provide your answer in either a PDF or Microsoft Word (.doc, .docx, or .rtf) file.  Files should be turned in using the BlackBoard site for the class, specifically using the turnin facility associated with Homework Assignment #1 found in the course documents. 

## Part II

Now, actually implement the puzzle game described above! 

### Bells and Whistles
Completing the above 4 requirements and having well-documented code with no errors will get you 45 out of 50 points, which is an A. You must complete one of the below ‘bells and whistles’ to get full points. You can complete as many of these as you want, but you will get no more than 10 points total. Different bonuses are worth different numbers of points, based on difficulty. You may receive up to 10 points for bells and whistles, bringing you up to up to 5 extra credit points.

1. **(3 points)** Add variety by using different images in your puzzle: Make your puzzle out of a variable number of images and randomly pick an image to show in your sliding puzzle.
2. **(3 points)** Instead of always making a 4x4 puzzle, randomly determine the number of rows and columns.
2. **(5 points)** Keyboard controls: when you press the up arrow key, make it move the tile below the empty tile up, and similarly with left, right, and down.
3. **(5 points)** Animate your tiles: When you click on a tile, instead of moving it, figure out how to get your tiles to animate to their desired location.
4. **(10 points)** Auto solver: Create a “solve me” button that shows the user how to solve the puzzle. Note you cannot just set the puzzle into its correct position as then the user won’t know how to actually solve it. You must wait a bit before you move each block (would go well with the animating bell). You should also create a “hint” button that gives the user a hint.
5. **(up to 10 points)** Make your page look awesome: Right now the sliding puzzle is just on a white page and doesn’t look very good. If you want you can design a web page to make your puzzle look very nice. I will assign a variable number of points here based on aesthetic appeal. If your page looks awesome you will get 10 points. Please make sure to include all files necessary in your turn in so I can see your puzzle correctly!
6. **(10 points)** Generate a puzzle from an image pulled from Flickr: You should be able to use the Flickr API to grab an image from some set and use this as your puzzle image.
7. **(N points)** Make your own clever adjustment.
 
Here are suggestions when implementing your code:

- Each tile in your puzzle should be a div. Remember, when you create divs in JavaScript you’re just creating a JavaScript object, so this means you can add extra properties and functions to help track that state of the game.
- Style the divs using JavaScript. This is not awesome in real software (style should usually go in CSS) but it makes things simpler for this assignment.
    - When you're doing this, note that hyphens in HTML/CSS are sort of equivalent to capital letters in JS. So if you would say background-image in HTML/CSS, say backgroundImage in JS.
- You shouldn’t need to cut up your puzzle image into a bunch of smaller images and then manually reference each image. Instead, you should take advantage of the [“CSS sprite trick”](http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/) to show portions of the completed image in your divs.

### Grading
Your assignment will be graded as follows:

- Turn in is correct, code has no syntax errors: 10 pts
- Tiles are correctly created and positioned: 10 pts
- Shuffling is implemented correctly: 5 pts
- When tiles are clicked, they move to empty tile correctly: 5 pts
- An alert is created when the puzzle is correct. 
- Bells and whistles	5 – 10 pts
- Formatting, comments, and coding style: 10 pts

You will lose 3 points if your submission is not in the correct format.

You will be graded on the quality of your code and commenting. This will include factors such as modularity, sensible method and variable names, and overall clarity. 
When in doubt, follow the [Google style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml). 


### Turning Your Program In

1. Get the following files together:
    - p1.js
    - p1.html
    - p1.css
    - Any images used
    - README.txt, which mentions any online sources you used to help with the project, as well as any notes about your programs (i.e. if you couldn’t get a particular part of the project to work). Also, please include a rough estimate of how many hours it took you.
3. Hand them in on Blackboard.

## Late Policy
Each 24 hrs late 10% will be deducted from your assignment grade. After 3 days late I will not accept assignments anymore.
