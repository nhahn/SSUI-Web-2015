In this lecture we discussed the fundamentals of Javascript. Here are some important things to remember:
- Use `===` over `==`, you will get more consistent results
- Javascript, a lot of the time, will not throw an error, but rather will return `undefined` or `null`. Check for these error values when making programs
- `console.log` is your best friend. It's probably the easiest way to debug code
