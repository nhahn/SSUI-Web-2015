We talked about modifying the DOM with Javascript and the jQuery library. Just a few things to remember:

- When modifying the DOM, make sure it is loaded first with `window.onload` or `$(function() { ... })`
- All jQuery selector's return an array
- You can chain jQuery elements together
- When you modify HTML elements, you are just modifying their attributes!
