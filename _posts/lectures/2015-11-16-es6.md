We learned about the CSS-extension language SASS today. (Specifically, the SCSS variant of it). We also talked about the features that ES6 add (including Promises!). Feel free to use either of these technologies in your final projects. I would highly recommend giving SASS a try. Try [compaass](http://compass-style.org/) as a way to compile SCSS into CSS.
