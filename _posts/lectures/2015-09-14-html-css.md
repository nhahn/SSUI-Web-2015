We went over the basics of HTML and CSS. Remember, HTML is just a tree (*very* similar to an interactor hierarchy). The differnt nodes have different attributes, with corresponding parents and children. HTML is just the **structure** of the web page. 

CSS provides us with all of the layout and styling. Some important CSS things we discussed include:

- The Cascade
- CSS Selectors
- Selector Specificity
- The display property
- The position property
