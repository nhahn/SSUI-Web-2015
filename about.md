<p>I'm a current 2nd year PhD student in the HCII department at CMU. My advisor is <a href="http://kittur.org/" target="_blank">Niki Kittur</a>, and I do research in information retreival and sensemaking. I make a lot of web based applications, with both server side components (mostly Node.js) and without (like Chrome extensions).</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:nhahn@cs.cmu.edu">nhahn@cs.cmu.edu</a> or post something on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/ic255tr83jz2g9" target="_blank">Piazza</a></p>
